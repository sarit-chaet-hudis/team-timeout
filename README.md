## Acknowledgements

- Game logic based on [Ania Kubow's tutorial](https://github.com/kubowania/candy-crush-reactjs/blob/main/src/App.js) which was a huge time saver! I did clean/reuse/generalize quite a bit.

- bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Emoji picker component by [emoji-picker-react](https://github.com/ealush/emoji-picker-react). worked like a charm and out of the box!!
